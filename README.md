# Reference

My biggest reference was the AAA game GOD OF WAR, which uses this system a lot.

# Objective
This functionality was made for my portfolio and to grow my programming skills.

Also, if you want to use this project for study, make money, etc., it's okay! Use it as you wish!

# How was done?

1.0 - Firstly, I've created an axe blueprint actor class to spawn it in the game beginning play in the character's hand. In addition to making a socket to decide the axe position and visualize it.

2.0 - After that, I've just made all the God of War axe mechanic logic (that consists of the character aim to some wall, throw the axe, it hit the wall, the character call it back, and its return to the character's hand). In addition to the possibility to call the axe back when it's in the midway to the wall.

3.0 - For the finish, I've configured the character animation logic to the throw action seem more realistic.
